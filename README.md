# NCAA Team Rankings Prediction

Welcome to my first project using Machine Learning.  This project predicts NCAA team rankings using an SVM model.
Decision Tree, KNN, and Logistic Regression models were also tested, but the SVM model had the best results.

## Description

The model is trained on historical data and can predict the postseason ranking of teams.

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Ashton-Carter/NCAARanking.git
   cd NCAARanking.git
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   streamlit run mLT.py

## Usage

The input is a CSV file that contains team information.  An example CSV file is provided "largeInput.csv".

## Notes

The model's training was created for an ML certificate through IBM and edX.
